## Obsidian Extended MathJax

This plugin extends the MathJax support in Obsidian with a MathJax preamble file which is loaded at startup. It also enables some additional MathJax extensions (notably `mhchem` and `bussproofs`). 

The preamble is stored in a `preamble.sty` file in the root of the vault. To reload changes to the preamble refresh the vault using `Cmd + R` / `Ctrl + R`.
